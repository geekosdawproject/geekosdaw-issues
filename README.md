## Package requests

For package requests, please follow the template.

## Bugs

For bugs, we might say, "submit that bug request upstream". 
Upstream means to the original creators of that package, and if we say so it means 
that we really can't do anything to fix the bug, since it's not related to
packaging but to the code itself.
